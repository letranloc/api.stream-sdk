# Example: Scene Composition with WebRTC
Using API.stream you can compose scene-based layouts solely using our APIs, enabling you to build broadcasts entirely by API from a backend without a front-end client or studio. This example project walks you through a sample app that sets up a broadcast and joins a WebRTC participant.

## Pre-requisites
- NodeJS 14+
- [A development API key](https://api.stream/docs/account/)
